##  Overview

Codefreaker is a CLI tool and library that aims to help contestants and setters from the competitive programming community to have an easier time.

Although trying to solve the issues of these two audiences seems to be too much for a single tool to handle, we exploit the fact that the journeys of contestants and setters have a lot in common.

##  Features

#### For contestants

- 🤖 **Parsing**: provides an entrypoint for contests and problems to be parsed through Competitive Companion.
- 🔨 **Testing**: provides commands for automatically running your problems against both downloaded and manually added testcases, and shows a clear report.
- 📤 **Submit**: provides the option of submiting your solution for a few supported online judges from the command line.
- 🧱 **Structure**: provides an opinionated structure for the file tree of both parsed and manually created problems.
- ⚙️ **Flexibility**: still gives enough flexibility for you to extend your problem. Add testcases, set a custom checker, write a generator.

#### For setters

🔜 Still coming up!

##  Getting Started

**System Requirements:** the tool was developed for Unix systems and was tested only in Ubuntu.

If you want to use the parsing feature, you also have to install [Competitive Companion](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion).

###  Installation

#### From `pip`

> [![PyPi](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/pypi?icon=pypi&label)](https://https://pypi.org/)
> ```console
> $ pip install codefreaker
> ```

#### From code

> Go to the cloned folder and run:
> ```console
> $ pip install .
> ```

#### In Poetry venv (while developing)

> Run the following when in the Poetry venv.
> ```console
> $ poetry install
> ```


###  Usage

#### 0. Be familiar with Competitive Companion

Make sure you're familiarized with [Competitive Companion](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion)
-- a helper that facilitates parsing tasks directly from your browser.

#### 1. Clone a contest or a single problem

```console
$ # Or simply `cfk c`
$ cfk clone
```

After running the command above, hit the ➕ (plus) icon in Competitive Companion,
and you should start seeing parsing logs in the command line.

#### 2. Implement a solution and run testcases

```console
$ # Or simply `cfk test A`
$ cfk test A
```
![test_wa](https://github.com/rsalesc/codefreaker/assets/4999965/309090e3-179b-4bd7-8961-a54fd109ac16)

#### 3. Submit your solution

```console
$ # Or simply `cfk s A`
$ cfk submit A
```
![submit](https://github.com/rsalesc/codefreaker/assets/4999965/153eb278-384b-401b-94a1-0b1df23ce4ad)
