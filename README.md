##  Overview

Codefreaker is a CLI tool and library that aims to help contestants and setters from the competitive programming community to have an easier time.

Although trying to solve the issues of these two audiences seems to be too much for a single tool to handle, we exploit the fact that the journeys of contestants and setters have a lot in common.

##  Features

#### For contestants

- 🤖 **Parsing**: provides an entrypoint for contests and problems to be parsed through Competitive Companion.
- 🔨 **Testing**: provides commands for automatically running your problems against both downloaded and manually added testcases, and shows a clear report.
- 📤 **Submit**: provides the option of submiting your solution for a few supported online judges from the command line.
- 🧱 **Structure**: provides an opinionated structure for the file tree of both parsed and manually created problems.
- ⚙️ **Flexibility**: still gives enough flexibility for you to extend your problem. Add testcases, set a custom checker, write a generator.

#### For setters

🔜 Still coming up!
